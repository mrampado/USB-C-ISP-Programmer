As per the details in each of the licenses, replication is accepted under the provision that all commercial and individual replications must also follow the same license as in this project, and **remain fully open source**. 

While not required, please contact me before starting any commercialization efforts. At the current moment, I am unable to commercialize this project thus unable to sell finished boards. I am happy to (in a limited capacity) support anyone / business that wants to utilize my efforts with ALP to use as a basis for teaching anyone and everyone Arduino. 

It is my personal belief that this project shall remain open source for the entire community, with all schematics, gerber files, and code available to all. I have benefited greatly from the open source community and this project will hopefully help others learn and get started too!
